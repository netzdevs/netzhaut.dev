            <p>Netzhaut is a <b>open-source web-browser-engine</b> written from scratch in C99. Web-Browser-Engines are software systems which run web content on client machines. Popular examples are Chromium (Chrome), Gecko (Firefox) and WebKit (Safari).</p>
            <p>The project is currently in the <b style="color:red;">prototyping</b> phase and thus not yet usable. The documentation is also heavy work-in-progress. Following is a list of development goals.</p>
            <p><b>Customizable</b></p>
            <p style="margin:10px;">Netzhaut implements a large array of technologies, primarily of course HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which can be used in many ways. Thus, netzhaut aims to provide a powerfull API so that developers can use netzhaut in as many use-cases as possible.</p>
            <p><b>Conform</b></p>
            <p style="margin:10px;">This is not a toy-project, Netzhaut is designed and written to implement web-technology specifications in a conformant manner.</p>
            <p><b>Lightweight</b></p>
            <p style="margin:10px;">Netzhaut aims to be lightweight by having as few dependencies as possible and by implementing a modular architecture, where modules are only required when needed.</p>
            <p><b>User Friendly</b></p>
            <p style="margin:10px;">For Netzhaut development, being lightweight is the first step to user friendliness. Additionally, netzhaut aims to provide self-updating capabilities and a generally hassle-free user experience.</p>
